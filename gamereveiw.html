    <ul>
      <li>8/10 game overall</li>
      <li>
        Good horror elements and great atmosphere but slow pacing and very much
        so too anime
      </li>
      <li>
        I recommend this for those that have a couple hours to waste but don't
        want to actually need much gameplay.
