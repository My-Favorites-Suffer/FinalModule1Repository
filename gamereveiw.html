      Doki Doki Literature Club is an indie horror visual novel disguised as a
      dating simulator.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>8/10 game overall</li>
      <li>
        Good horror elements and great atmosphere but slow pacing and very much
        so too anime
      </li>
      <li>
        I recommend this for those that have a couple hours to waste but don't
        want to actually need much gameplay.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>A fun series, Five Nights at Freddy's is an indie horror classic.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>9/10 game overall</li>
      <li>
        Great lore, and awsome puzzles, but the main gameplay is often a bit
        boring in the early nights.
      </li>
      <li>
        I reccomend this for people that are looking for a longtime hobby, as
        even using speedrunning strategies it takes well over 12 hours for
        accomplished speedrunners to finish all the main games.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A standalone psychological horror about a boy facing forgotten traumas...
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>10/10 game overall</li>
      <li>Cute artstyle, not so great gameplay, and a chilling atmosphere.</li>
      <li>
        I reccomend this for people that are looking for a middle time-span
        hobby, as the game is around twenty ro thirty hours long.
      </li>
